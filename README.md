# BayesReg PyMC


Example code to perform Bayesian regularization using the PyMC probabilistic programming language and its associated ecosystem of packages. The package provides models for conducting Bayesian regularization for linear regression models.

The models here are reproductions of the models implemented by Sara van Erp in the Stan programming language, which can be found at [Sara van Erp's bayesreg repository](https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg).

Currently, the main body of work is simply producing PyMC implementations of these models for my own use. If there is a desire, it can be packaged up.
