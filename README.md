# BayesReg PyMC

Example code perform Bayesian regularisation using the PyMC probablisitic programming langauge and its associated ecosystem of packages. The package provides models for conducting Bayesian regularization for linear regression models.

The model here are reproductions of the models implemented by Sara van Erp in the stan programming language that can be found at https://github.com/sara-vanerp/bayesreg/tree/master/src/stan_files

Currently the main body of work is simple producing pymc implentations of these models for my own use. If their is the desire it can be packaged up.
